This project explores the use of a [flocking algorithm](https://codeheir.com/2021/03/27/the-flocking-algorithm/) to create generative visuals and music. The aim is to produce an ambient piece where the soundscape is controlled by the emergent behaviour of autonomously moving entities. More interactive elements and behavioural patterns could be added in the future. Thanks to [boardtobits](https://github.com/boardtobits/flocking-algorithm) for providing the flocking algorithm that this project was based on. 

Built in Unity Engine 2020.3.25f1.
